# Personal Portfolio - Front End Development

This GitHub repository serves as the personal portfolio project for my front-end development freelance work. Here, you'll find information about me, my past projects, what's currently in the pipeline, my skills, and how to get in touch with me. 

## About Me

Graduating from university with a postgraduate certification in education, I worked as a primary school teacher for a number of years before reaching a pivot point. As rewarding as teaching is, I couldn't envisage spending my life in the profession.

My passion for technology began as a teenager. I took apart computers - I wanted to figure out how they worked. Later, my first introduction to coding was creating a snazzy Myspace profile (anyone remember them?) as a young teen.

Now, as a front-end developer, I create clean, interactive web applications for my clients from my home in London.

Thank you, Myspace, for sparking my interest in this exciting field!
